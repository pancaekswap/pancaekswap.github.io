Swapping on Pancake Swap involves trading one BEP-20 token for another via their automated liquidity pools. Keep in mind that since you’re only able to trade tokens with other tokens, you aren’t able to directly buy cryptocurrency using a traditional currency via Pancake Swap.

<br>
<br>3. Choose the token you want to trade to.
<br>Using this same calculator, use the drop-down menu in the bottom section to choose the coin you want to trade to.
<br>
<br>4. Enter the amount
<br>You can enter either the number of coins you want to receive or the number of coins you wish to exchange. Once you enter an amount into one of the fields, the other field will be calculated for you automatically. A small breakdown will also appear below the calculator.
<br>
<br>5. Review the details and click ‘Swap’
<br>Once you’ve made sure that all the amounts are correct and that you’re happy with the fees and slippage tolerance, you can confirm that Swap.
<br>

Just make sure to select CAKE as the token you wish to trade to, then you’ll be able to get CAKE in exchange for a BEP-20 token of your choice.
